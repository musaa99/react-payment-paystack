# Getting Started with Paystack and React

This repository includes a sample application that shows how to integrate Paystack payments to your React apps.

The sample app is a simple checkout form to purchase an item and check out using the [Paystack Popup](https://paystack.com/docs/payments/accept-payments/#popup) checkout. It uses [iamraphson's](https://github.com/iamraphson) [react-paystack](https://github.com/iamraphson/react-paystack) library.

The library offers 3 integration methods:
- [Using hooks](https://github.com/iamraphson/react-paystack#1-using-the-paystack-hook)
- [Using a `<PaystackButton/>` component](https://github.com/iamraphson/react-paystack#2-using-the-paystack-button)
- [Using the Context API](https://github.com/iamraphson/react-paystack#3-using-the-paystack-consumer)

This sample uses the `<PaystackButton/>` component, but you can swap it out for any of the other methods. All 3 methods will bear the same results
